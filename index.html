	  	<p class = "contentSmall">Why study journalism? Writing matters. Good writing is a skill developed over years. 
			</p>
	  	<p class = "contentSmall">My hope is to gain experience in Communication, Organizational Writing/Marketing/Digital Media management in the form of paid and unpaid internships. I hope to learn from seasoned professionals in various roles in an organization.
			</p>
	  	<p class = "contentSmall">Thus far, I have completed one internship at the campus TV station and I really enjoyed it. During those weeks, I had the opportunity to learn about editing, camerawork, and producing a show.  It was great to contribute in even a small way to each show. I look forward to further activity with the station, as I complete my education.  My writing began as a way to get experience creating material for a standup show. However, as I have studied journalism at the University of Tennessee, I have seen  the value of practice, observation, editing, review and revision. </p>

		<p class = "contentSmall">My hobbies include video gaming, hiking, music, and photography and my goal with photography is to create great framing of my content.  I love being outdoors and especially enjoy doing outdoor and event photography.
